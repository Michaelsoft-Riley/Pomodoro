- Display currently selected task above clock 
- Add option to stop the current focus timer. This should call RecordFocusTime()
- Add option to pause the current timer.
- Add option to start or skip break
- Add option to select a task. Focus time will be saved to file with the task name listed.
- Calculate focus time for each task for each day over the past week and month from file.
